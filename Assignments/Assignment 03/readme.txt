TO DO:

As you create a rectangle, it needs to be stored in a linked list that behaves like a stack. If you 
view the current code, we create a rectangle and it goes away as soon as we draw a new rectangle. 
This should not happen because now we will save all the rectangles in the linked list. You will then 
need to go through the entire linked list and draw every rectangle. It behaves like a stack because 
the new rectangle will be drawn on top of the previous rectangle. Every time you draw something, it 
will have a random color.

You should draw the rectangle by default, but if you press ‘P’ you start drawing a Point on mouse 
click. If your press ‘L’ you will start drawing a line. At any time you press the ‘Down Arrow’ key, 
your drawn object will move down in the list. Suppose you drew a red rectangle and then drew a white 
rectangle on top of the red rectangle and then you press the down arrow key, the red rectangle will 
now be drawn on top of the white rectangle. The process will reverse if I now press the ‘Up Arrow’ key.

With the left mouse button we finish drawing a rectangle or any other object. With the right mouse 
button we should be able to undo what we have done so far, but by pressing the middle moose button 
we will be able to redo what we did in the past. In case you undo a few drawings and start drawing, 
then you will not be able to redo everything that was undone.
